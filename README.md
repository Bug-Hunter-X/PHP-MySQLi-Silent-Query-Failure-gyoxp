This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in PHP when using MySQLi: silent failure due to unhandled exceptions within a try-catch block. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code where a database query is attempted within a try-catch block.  However, the catch block only logs the error without taking corrective action, potentially leading to inconsistent application behavior. The `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version with proper error handling, ensuring the application behaves gracefully even upon database query failures.
