This code suffers from a silent failure due to an unhandled exception within the try-catch block.  The `mysqli_query()` function might throw an exception if the database query fails, which is caught by the `catch` block. However, the `catch` block only logs the error and doesn't do anything to gracefully handle the failure.  The script continues executing after the catch block, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or further errors because the database operation was not successful. The user might not be aware of the failure.
